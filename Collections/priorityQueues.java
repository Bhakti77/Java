/*A PriorityQueue is used when the objects are supposed to be processed based on the priority. 
It is known that a Queue follows the First-In-First-Out algorithm, but sometimes the elements of the 
queue are needed to be processed according to the priority, thatâ€™s when the PriorityQueue comes into play.*/
